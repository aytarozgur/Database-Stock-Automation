# Database-Stock-Automation


I've created own database by MySQL (phpmyadmin). We connected from Netbeans IDE to database. We can insert, delete, update and search.

In Database each entity has an unique id so we can easily search. It has 6 entities. 

These are Category, Customer, Order Detail, Order, Product and Supplier.
